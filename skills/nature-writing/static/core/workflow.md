# Writing workflow

Run these steps for any drafting or restructuring task. Steps 1-3 are planning, step 3b is an alignment gate, 4-6 are drafting, 7-8 are checking.

## 1. Build a one-sentence argument

> In [system/problem], we show [advance] using [approach], supported by [evidence], with [boundary].

Force every section to serve this sentence. If the sentence cannot be written, the paper does not yet have an argument — surface that to the user.

## 1b. Build the Terminology Ledger

On first contact with the material, extract the recurring terms, abbreviations, notation, and proper names into a Terminology Ledger before drafting any prose. Lock the canonical forms and reuse them across every section. See `../../../_shared/core/terminology-ledger.md`.

## 2. Choose section architecture

Pick the section structure from the relevant `section/*.md` fragment and, if needed, deeper patterns from `references/article-architecture.md`.

## 3. Map each paragraph to one job

Each paragraph must do exactly one job from: context, gap, approach, result, comparison, mechanism, implication, limitation.

If a paragraph carries two jobs, split it before drafting.

## 3b. Confirmation gate — align before drafting

Drafting a full section on a wrong assumed premise wastes the whole draft and is the main reason output "does not match what I meant". Before writing full prose, show the user a short alignment block and **stop for confirmation**:

- **One-sentence argument** (from step 1) — the single most important thing to get right. Echo it back in plain language.
- **Plan**: detected paper type, section(s), journal / word limit, and the paragraph map from step 3 as a short bullet list.
- **Key assumptions**: anything you inferred rather than were told — especially what the core contribution is, who the audience is, and which result to lead with. Mark each clearly as an assumption.
- **At most 2–3 targeted questions**, only on genuinely ambiguous, high-leverage points (how to frame the core contribution, target audience / journal, which result leads). Do not ask about things the user already made clear, and do not pad the list to reach three.

Then wait for the user to confirm or correct before drafting the full section.

Two shortcuts:

- **Skip the gate** when the core claim, evidence, and boundary are all clearly given and there is no real ambiguity in framing. In that case just state the one-sentence argument in a single line (per the router) and proceed.
- **Style, not substance**: if the user says the voice or style "is not mine", do not keep guessing — ask for one short sample of their own writing to match.

## 4. Draft from evidence outward

Keep claims near the data that support them. Do not stack claims at the top of a section then leave evidence at the bottom.

## 5. Calibrate verbs to evidence strength

`show` / `demonstrate` need strong direct evidence. `suggest` / `indicate` are for trend-level or indirect evidence. `may` / `could` are for plausible but unverified mechanisms.

## 6. Remove unsupported novelty and universal claims

Sweep for `first`, `unique`, `unprecedented`, `comprehensive`, `complete`, `always`, `never`. Replace with bounded claims or delete.

## 7. Run a paragraph-flow check

- One paragraph, one message.
- The first sentence is the topic / claim.
- Each subsequent sentence has an explicit relation to the previous one (cause, comparison, restriction, example).

For full reverse-outlining, open `references/paragraph-flow.md`.

## 8. Return prose plus notes

Output the draft together with explicit notes on assumptions, missing inputs, and where evidence is needed. See `output-format.md`.
